# DigitalCommunications_Practical1
## Introduction'
You are to develop a simulation platform1
for a BPSK, 4QAM, 8PSK and 16QAM communication system transmitting information over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
channel. To realise the simulation platform, you will need a number of building bocks, a uniform random number generator to generate random bits and a Gaussian random
number generator to generate Gaussian noise.
